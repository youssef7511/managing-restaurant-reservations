 fullstuck web with django for back and front-end and sqllite for database 
Request Initiation: A client, which can be a web browser or an API client, sends a request to my application.
Web Server Interface: The request is received by the WSGI/ASGI server, which is the standard way Python web applications communicate with a web server.
URL Routing:
Django's main urls.py (mon_projet/mon_projet/urls.py) first processes the URL from the request.
It then typically forwards the URL to be handled by the specific application's urls.py (mon_projet/mon_app/urls.py).
View Processing:
The application's urls.py maps the URL to a specific view in views.py.
This view contains the core logic for handling the request.
Interaction with Data:
The view interacts with the models defined in models.py. These models represent the structure of your data in the db.sqlite3 database.
If the request is for the API, the view will use a serializer from serializers.py to convert the data from the models into a format like JSON.
Response Generation:
For a regular web request, the view renders an HTML template from the templates directory, which may include static files (CSS, JS) from the static directory.
For an API request, the view returns the serialized data directly.
Sending the Response: The generated response is sent back through the layers to the original client.
